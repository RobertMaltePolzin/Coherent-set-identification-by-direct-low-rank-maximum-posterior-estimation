Matlab code for numerical examples of coherent set identification by direct low-rank maximum posterior estimation: R. M. Polzin, "Reduced stochastic modeling of atmospheric processes on different scales", Chapter 7, 2024.

The code uses two Matlab-based software packages: 

1. GAIO described in: M. Dellnitz, G. Froyland, and O. Junge. "The algorithms behind GAIO - Set oriented numerical methods for dynamical systems." In Ergodic theory, analysis, and efficient simulation of dynamical systems, pages 145â€“174. Springer, 2001.
